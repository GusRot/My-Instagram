Obs: It is important to note that the Timeline content is my own. Youtube, by default, does not allow hiding the name of the channel and the title of the video that it is sharing for copyright reasons, but as they are exclusive content of my channel, I took the liberty of making these changes for the local environment, for learning purposes. and studies to make this replica as faithful as possible.
